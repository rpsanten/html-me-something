          At around the year 586 BC Nebuchadnezzer was the most powerful man on the planet. His empire included all 
          of Mesopotamia, the Levant, Egypt, part of Arabia, and a good chunk of the region that today would be  Turkey. 
          One of the conquered nations was Israel. And like their predecessors the Assyrians, the Babylonians exiled much of the 
          populations they conquered and replaced them with other exiles. One of the Israelites exiled to Babylonia was 
          a young Jewish man named Daniel. Because of his youthly features, he was selected to serve, along with other 
          Israelites, in the King's presence.

          One night, the king(Nebuchadnezzar) was disturbed by a mysterious dream that he didn't understand. His 
          solution was simple: demand that his wisemen tell him the dream and it's interpretation, and if they don't, 
          exectute them! As the king's men set forth to begin slaughtering the wisemen, Daniel asked to speak with
          the king. He then proceeded to explain to the king that although he was unable to know the dream and it's 
          interpretation, his God could reveal it. God revealed to Daniel both the dream and it's interpretation. The king had a 
          dream about a giant statue with a gold head, chest and arms of silver, belly and thighs of brass, legs of 
          iron, and feet mixed partly of clay, and partly of iron. Then, a stone cut without hands smashed into the 
          statue's feet and destroyed the entire thing, and then became a giant mountain that filled the entire earth.
          Daniel explained that the head of gold represented Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom, and the other parts represented three
          successive kingdoms that would come after his. Then God would establish His kingdom on the earth.

        Later in Daniel's life, during the reign of Belshazzar, Daniel had a dream about the four kingdoms himself. This time
        the kingdoms were represented by four giant beasts that came out of the sea. The first one was a lion with wings, 
        who then stood on two feet like a man.

       The first beast represents Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom of Babylon. The reason that the beast was made to stand on two
       feet like a man is because of the transformation that occured in the heart of Nebuchadnezzar. As punishment for his ruthlesness
       and lack of mercy, God forces him to roam the earth like a wild beast for a period of seven years, during which time
       he developed animal-like features including talons. At the end of his punishemnt Nebuchadnezzar has a change of heart 
       and priases God.

      The second beast was a bear raised on one side with three ribs between its teeth. This beast represents 
      the Medo-Persian empire which was founded by Cyrus the Great. Under King Cyrus, many of the Jewish exiles
      were allowed to return to the land of Israel. Despite common myths, the Persian rulers tended to be more 
      diplomatic than a lot of other world empires. They typically allowed for more autonomy and allowed religious
      freedom. By doing this they were able to keep the peace within the empire.

      The third beast was a leopard with four wings and four heads. It represents the kingdom of Greece and the four
      empires it was divided into upon Alexander the Great's death. The Greeks have left a lasting influence on the 
      world and during their reign the Greek language became a lingua franca.

    The last beast was quite the ferocious looking monster. It had ten horns and three of the horns were then replaced by
    a little horn that could talk. There is much controversy regarding the fourth beast. A general consensus is that
    it's Rome. However, it's also specualted that the little horn represents the antichrist, which is problematic. A common
    interpretation is that it represents the Roman empire and Europe, since the Roman empire still influences the world
    today. It's speculated that the new world order will come from a revived Roman empire or will come from western Europe.
    There are problems with the Roman empire interpretation though as well. The fact that Rome did not immediately succeed 
    the Grecian empire as the ruler of the Promised Land and the Jewish people. The other issue is what exactly is meant by the 
    mixed feet of clay and iron, which indicated a divided empire which would be partly strong and partly weak, and mingle
    with the people. Another interpretation is that the fourth beast represented the governemnt ruled by religious zealots. 
    For politcal reasons, this interpretation has become less popular in the modern age, despite the fact that both Jewish 
    and Christian sources attest to the fact that the religious sect of the zealots was quite ruthless to all who opposed them, 
    espeically their own people. There are various theories as to why this intepretaiton has become less popular with certian modern 
    "religious" groups. At the end of the day nobody really knows for certain, or do they?

      Another vision that Daniel had was of a one-horned goat fighting a ram. The ram had two horns, representing the 
      kigndoms of the Persians and the Medes. The single horn represents Alexander the great. After defeating the ram, 
      the one horn of the goat is broken off and replaced by 4 more horns. These horns represnt the 4 Greek kingdoms
      that came about after Alexander the Great's death when his conquered territroy was divided between his four generals:
      Seleucus, Ptolemy, Lysimachus and Cassander. Amongst the horns a smaller horn emerged that will be discussed in 
      the next section.

  Antiochus IV Epiphanes is confirmed by both Jewish and other sources to have been a cruel dictator. He ruled 
  Syria from 175 to 164 BC. As part of his tyrannical atittude toward the Jewish people he desecrated their sanctuary and put 
  an end to sacrifce. The Maccabean revolt soon followed, the succes of which is celebrated by the holiday called 
  the Festival of Light or Hannukah.

   The fourth kingdom is believed by most to be the empire of Rome, which conquered Judea in 63 BC. Up until that time
   the Jews lived in an independent state ruled by the Hasmonean dynasty. This is where things get a little tricky though,
   because the fourth kingdom is the last kingdom. A common interpetation is that the feet of the statue represent 
   a new world order that will somehow be related to the Roman Empire, possibly even a revived one. Since western Europe
   has deep roots from the Roman Empire, this interpretation is somewhat plausible. Additionally, this empire will be based
   on some sort of global religion. It is believed that in this global empire a mark or microchip will be madatory for economic exchange. 
   The rock crashing into the feet of the statue that then becomes a mountain represents God's kingdom. For some Christians, they believe this 
   coincides with the second coming of Christ, and that the stone is Jesus based on New Testament metaphors.  For others, they believe that sharing 
   the love of Christ with people is the current kingdom on this earth. Regardless, the book of Daniel says the mountain represents God's kingdom, 
   which has comforted many people for centuries.

  All in all, the book of Daniel is a great place to start for anyone who desires to learn more about Biblical prophecy and symbolism. Regardless of one's religious 
  affiliation, the book of Daniel is still a good read because of its excellent narrative, and its thought- provoking symbolism. Additionally, one can learn about 
  ancient history and differences of religious opinions amongst the various monotheistic faith traditions. It must be acknowledged that the intepretation provdied 
  herein is not the only one that exists. Considering the fact that these prophecies have been debated for hundreds of years, the reader is strongly encouraged, if 
  so desired, to investigate and decide for themselves whether or not the aformentioned interpreation is the best one.
